# [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

## Problem

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more
letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

#### Constraints

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Examples

```text
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

```text
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

## Solution

```rust
pub fn find_the_difference(s: String, t: String) -> char {
    let mut s_freq = [0; 26];
    let mut t_freq = [0; 26];

    s.as_bytes()
        .iter()
        .for_each(|&b| s_freq[(b - b'a') as usize] += 1);

    t.as_bytes()
        .iter()
        .for_each(|&b| t_freq[(b - b'a') as usize] += 1);

    for idx in 0..s_freq.len() {
        if s_freq[idx] != t_freq[idx] {
            return (idx as u8 + b'a') as char;
        }
    }

    return '@';
}
```
