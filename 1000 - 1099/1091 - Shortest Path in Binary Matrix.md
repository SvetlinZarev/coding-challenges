# [1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)

## Problem

Given an `n x n` binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear
path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return `-1`.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (
i.e., `(0, 0)`) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., `(n - 1, n - 1)`) such that:

* All the visited cells of the path are `0`.
* All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they
  are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

#### Constraints

* `n == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`

#### Examples

```text
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
```

```text
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4
```

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: -1
```

## Solution

The easiest solution is to use the Dijkstra algorithm. It's essentially the same
as A*, but with a heuristic that always returns 0.

In order for A* to work we have to choose a proper heuristic. On the
[Stanford](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#heuristics-for-grid-maps)
website, for 8-directionally connected cells it's recommended to use "Diagonal
Distance":

* On a square grid that allows 4 directions of movement, use Manhattan
  distance (L1).
* On a square grid that allows 8 directions of movement, use Diagonal distance (
  Lâˆž).
* On a square grid that allows any direction of movement, you might or might not
  want Euclidean distance (L2). If A* is finding paths on the grid but you are
  allowing movement not on the grid, you may want to consider other
  representations of the map.
* On a hexagon grid that allows 6 directions of movement, use Manhattan distance
  adapted to hexagonal grids.
